# Data-Science-Portfolio
**Objective -** 
This is a repository created in line with my understanding &amp; implementation of the major complex ideas in Machine Learning &amp; Inferential Statistics. The motivation behind creating this open source resource is to validate my theoretical knowledge about these models and give back to the online community in terms of a structured and exhaustive format of learning fundamental concepts and best practices of Data Science in the industry.

**Constituent Elements -** 
This repository includes the following elements broadly:
1. **Tutorial/comparison/benchmarking notebooks (In the form of end-to-end ML mini projects)** for most of the popular ML and associated data science algorithms like sampling, feature selection, model interpretability, hypothesis testing in the following manner:

      1. [**Statistical Inference**](https://github.com/srikhetramohanty/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Statistical%20Inference/hypothesis-testing-cheat-sheet.ipynb) - Most of the major hypothesis tests and their pre-requisites/use-cases clearly outlined through a hierarchy
      2. [**Pre-Processing of data**](https://github.com/srikhetramohanty/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Mini%20Projects/Pre-Processing%20Pipeline/samplng-techniques-for-imbalanced-classification.ipynb) - Handling extreme imbalance in classes through statistical sampling
      3. [**Feature Selection**](https://github.com/srikhetramohanty/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Mini%20Projects/Feature%20Selection/feature-selection-for-classification-problems.ipynb) - Generating feature importances and performing feature selection corresponding to supervised learning
      4. [**Explainable ML**](https://github.com/srikhetramohanty/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Mini%20Projects/ML%20Explainability/model-explainability-for-classification.ipynb) - Interpreting the intuition of predictions emanating out of the complex black box models 
      5. [**Comparison of Dimensionality Reduction Techniques**](https://github.com/srikhetramohanty/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Mini%20Projects/Dimensionality%20Reduction/dimensionality-reduction-techniques.ipynb) - Comparison of performance between various dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA, t-SNE & UMAP on a real ML pipeline
      6.  [**Comparison of Dimensionality Reduction Techniques v2 (Malware data)**](https://github.com/srikhetramohanty/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Mini%20Projects/Dimensionality%20Reduction/dimensionality-reduction-techniques-malware-data.ipynb) - Comparison of performance between various dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA, t-SNE & UMAP on a real ML pipeline (Malware data classification)
      7. [**Comparison of Clustering Techniques**](https://github.com/srikhetramohanty/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Mini%20Projects/Clustering%20Algorithms/major-clustering-algorithms.ipynb) - Comparison of performance between various clustering techniques like K-Means, Agglomerative/Hierarchial, DBSCAN & HDBSCAN on a real ML pipeline
      
2. **From-scratch implementations (using numpy)** of most of the commonly used ML models like linear models, CART, gradient boosting, DBSCAN, artificial neural networks etc. These from-scratch implementations have been created based on extensive personal research from online resources available and validated against the necessary benchmarks like Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow, Scipy etc. For all the cases, the manual implementations have matched up or outperformed the open source python benchmarking libraries mentioned above.   
These include the following:
      1. **Statistical Inference from scratch** - Manual implementation of popular hypothesis tests like t-test, Kruskal Wallis, Friedmans's test etc. for higher visibility into the inner workings. _These have been benchmarked against the available scipy & statsmodels versions_
            1. [**Hypothesis testing**](https://github.com/srikhetramohanty/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Statistical%20Inference/major-hypothesis-tests-from-scratch.ipynb) from scratch
      2. **Supervised ML from scratch** - Manual implementation of popular classical ML algorithms used for classification & regression. _These have been benchmarked against the available Scikit-Learn or relevant versions_. These include the following:
